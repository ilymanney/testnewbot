## Commands 
List of all commands can be found [here](Commands.md)
## Requirements

- Node.js (v16.6 or higher)
- NPM

## Installation

simply clone the repo and install the packages : 

```
git clone https://github.com/naseif/Eyesense-Music-Bot.git
cd Eyesense-Music-Bot
npm i
```
if you are having problems installing sodium or libsodium-wrappers, make sure to install the following packages `sudo apt-get install autoconf make automake g++ libtool -y`

## Configuration

### What you will need:

- Your own Bot token
- prefix
- [mongodb url](https://account.mongodb.com/account/login) 
- genius ApiKey (For lyrics <optional>) 
- TMDb Key (For tv and movie search <optional>)

First you need to create a new application in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and then create a bot to get your own discord Token and invite the bot to your server. A complete guide is available on [here](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html#creating-your-bot). 

Once you got your key, rename `config.example.json` to `config.json`. Now open the `config.json` file and add your data.

Once you are done, you can now start the bot by running the following: 
```node index.js```

Since play-dl is being used as alternative for ytdl-core, a manual configuration for spotify is needed. You can find the instructions [here](https://github.com/play-dl/play-dl/discussions/64)

As of this moment, there is no need to configure soundcloud manuely after play-dl latest update!
### Recommendation

Use pm2 to run the bot in the background and automatically restart it when e.g. your server has internet issues:

Simply install the pm2 package globally using ```npm i pm2 -g``` and then instead of ```node index.js``` run ```pm2 start index.js```
